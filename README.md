See it live: [Guess the Number Game](https://silver-arithmetic-ce1cc3.netlify.app/)

## Description
A two-player game to see who can be first to guess a number between 1 and 20.

## Background & Motivation
I built this game for my niece and newphew as a fun little project to help me practice my JavaScript.


## Technologies
* HTML 
* CSS
* JavaScript


## State of Completion
Completed, but not responsive as this was not the primary aim of the project.


## Learning Lessons & Challenges
### Generating a random number between 1 and 20
This was a helpful review in using the Math.random() and Math.floor() methods for random number generation within a provided range, 1-20 in this case.

### Player Turns
Implementing the functionality of turn-taking was a fun task, as there were many things to consider. I could perhaps have found a way to do it more efficiently, but overall I was pleased with the result.


## Summary
Another fun little project which I enjoyed coding and letting my niece and nephew try out - which I am happy to say they liked! If this was a real game accessible to the public, I would of course have provided functionality for users to enter their own names before starting the game.
